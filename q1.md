This code analyzes data on the representation of various demographic groups in the film industry, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. By examining this data over a period of time, the code is able to track changes in diversity within the industry. This information can be useful in understanding the trends and patterns in the representation of different groups in the film industry, and can help identify areas where more progress is needed in terms of diversity and inclusion. Additionally, analyzing changes in diversity over time can provide insight into the impact of various initiatives and efforts to promote diversity within the industry, and can inform strategies for future efforts to increase representation and inclusion.

In this first demonstration, we will examine the trends in the representation of women in film casts over time, analyzing the percentage of women in various cast roles such as leading actors, supporting actors, and extras.

Note the significant drop in female percentage of movie casts around the 1940s. This could be potentially explained by looking at the historical context. This time period was marked by significant social and cultural changes, including World War II and the emergence of the Hollywood studio system, which may have had an impact on the representation of women in film.

The following code analyzes data on the representation of various ethnic groups in the film industry, tracking changes in the number of actors from different ethnic backgrounds over time. It is important to note that the data on the representation of ethnic groups in the film industry has been categorized into broader categories for the purpose of this analysis. While we have made every effort to accurately represent the diversity of ethnicities within the film industry, this categorization process may involve some subjectivity and may not capture the full range of ethnicities represented.

Based on the data shown in the graph, it appears that the gap between the representation of Caucasian and minority ethnicities in the film industry has shrunk over the years. While movies are still primarily dominated by Caucasian casts, this trend suggests that there has been an increase in the representation of minority ethnicities in film casts over time, relative to the representation of Caucasian ethnicities. While this is an encouraging trend, it is important to note that there may still be disparities in the representation of different ethnicities within the industry, and further efforts may be needed to ensure that all ethnicities are equally represented in film casts.

We can now perform a one-sampled t-test to show if the representation of Caucasians in film is statistically significantly different.

```
T-statistic: 26.282
P-value: 0.000
There is a statistically significant difference between the mean percentage of Caucasian ethnicity in movie casts and the null hypothesis of the Caucasian population of the world.
```

According to the one-sample t-test conducted, the mean percentage of Caucasians in movie casts across multiple time periods is statistically significantly different from the percentage of Caucasians in the population. While this is not particularly surprising, given the historical dominance of Caucasians in the entertainment industry, it is important to examine and understand these disparities in representation. However, it is worth noting that the industry has been trending towards more equal representation in terms of ethnicity in recent years, and there has been increasing recognition of the need for diversity and inclusion in media.
